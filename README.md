### Software accounts and installs: 

1.  https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2018/blob/master/INSTALL_JUPYTER_UNIDATA.md

1. Install the IDV
   * Install the IDV nightly build from Undiata. https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/idv/nightly/index.jsp You will need to create a light sign-in, just so they know whoâ€™s using it. Great free software, my group (and Xingchen in class) are involved with integrating it into Jupyter notebooks. 
1. Matlab 
   * Matlab is free to you while you are at UM. You will need to create an account with them, verify license tokens, etc.  It is very powerful, and very well documented with lots of hand-holding features, but it is commercial and proprietary. I will not use my course to create a generation of addicts to it, but you might end up using it -- lots of scientists do, and a big body of working, legacy code is nothing to sneer at. You can install it from here: http ://it.miami.edu/a-z-listing/matlab/index.html
