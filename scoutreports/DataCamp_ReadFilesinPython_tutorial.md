# Quick summary and links to helpful file reading tutorial

url:  https://www.datacamp.com/courses/importing-data-in-python-part-1

This is a free and easy tutorial that guides you through the commands for importing basic files like .txt or .csv.  
I have found it useful because half of my data is available in .txt format rather than .nc and the process is a little different.
Also, it gives you points for doing things correctly, which although they don't actually mean anything, helps motivate me a little more.

Keep in mind, you'll have to register, but it takes about 3 seconds if you have a gmail account and click the google log-in option.

# Introduction and flat files
  - You'll learn some of the basic mechanics and functions for importing and reading "flat files" using both NumPy and pandas
    -i.e. files like text and csv files that don't have multiple, interconnected tables, etc.
  - You'll learn about which method (NumPY or pandas) will work better based on the data you're importing
# Importing data from other file types
  - You'll learn how to import more complex files like Excel sheets, MATLAB files, etc.
# Working with relational databases in Python
  - I don't know that anyone will need this unit but you'll learn how to import and work with relational databases, create database engines, etc.
