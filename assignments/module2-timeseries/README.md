# Series data: 

1. Learn the concepts and vocabulaty in TestAssignment.md

2. Execute the notebooks here, and use their tools on data of your own -- hopefully toward your course project. 

3. As always, scout out and please share what you find on the Web that might be of general interest. Be an active learner. 

### For 2D data (images), download example notebooks in sections 1.5 and 2.6 of http://www.scipy-lectures.org/index.html.
