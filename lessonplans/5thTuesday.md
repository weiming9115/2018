# Second week of basic stats

1. A couple scouting reports! Let's look at them. And assign some more...

2. How's the histograms-kernels-scatterplots assignment (our first sub-lab) coming? For Thursday.

## Rationality's simplest tool for measuring its simplest relationship: XY

### Whiteboard example of cov-cor-reg for continuous data

1. Postulate your relationship form, explicitly!
  - for scientific theory reasons (physical formulations)
  - for statistics theory reasons (parsimony, Occam's razor, _overfitting_ concerns) 

2. Apply principles: 
  - parameter estimation: maximizing how much the postulated term captures (residue is _uncorrelated_)
  - the "principle" of least squares (residue _size is minimized_) 
  - **these are the same** but the first seems philosophically clearer 
  
#### Nutshell lessons

* Regression is _asymmetric_: Reg of Y on X reg(Y,X) is different from X on Y reg(X,Y)
* Both _explain the same fractional variance_ (but of Y vs. of X, respectively)
* There is another thing: the line in between. 
  * An axis that maximizes the _joint variance_ (X'^2 + Y'^2)
  * Our first glimpse of an EOF!
  
#### Scout or TA? _Mutual information_ theory (or _maximum entropy_ principle)

### Whiteboard example of contingency tables, and intuitive challenges for discrete outcomes

"The Monty Hall Problem" 

Medical applications: there's such a thing as too much screening!

#### Nutshell lesson
Just count integers! 
  - Probability formulas are toooooo slippery, multiplying numbers in [0,1].
