## Scouting report from Xingchen

## A few more words about using the course repostory. 
#### Yes. it's a bit complicated! 
  * I hate the new desktop client! 
    * Mac users: Grab the old app from https://central.github.com/mac/latest. MUCH CLEARER! 
    * Windows users: Maybe there's a better one here? https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis
1. Keep working toward learning Git and GitHub repository orientation. See [the image of my screen](MPO624-2018/classnotes/images/2018-01-23_Cloud_and_local_repos_layout.png), showing the relationship between the Web versions MPO624/master (upper left) and myname/master, my **fork** (upper right, a little lower) and the local repo on my working machine (bottom windows). See how the Github client in the middle is the key to holding all these together. 
1. Your **fork** can be renamed as you like. I was foolish to initially call it just "2018". Let's rename it to MPO624-2018 on the Web browser. 
1. You MUST have a local clone of your fork, in order to update your fork from the upstream master (MPO624/master). I don't know why this is true, but it is true. You can only _Update from MPO624/master_ in the desktop client, pointing to your local folder where your course repo lives. Then you can "Sync" your local repo to your Web repo, and that will then be up to date. 
1. If your edits have not been reflected in https://github.com/MPO624/MPO624-2018/blob/master/PARTICIPANTLIST.md, please make an edit (on the Web portal is fine; no need to involve your local machine's clone) and create a pull request. 

Keep watching the course repo as I improve it, studying a few notebooks in your live notebook server, and just making some time to work gently, curiously, gradually to understand the space of our computer materials (Jupyter, Python, GitHub). **As I am!**


## But, ... The Purpose: The **Applied** in ADA
Tuesdays are more for the _theory_ of data analysis and the science it supports -- not computers (once we are all up and rolling, in the weeks ahead). 

To get a start on that,
