One last student presents their science paper deconstruction. 

Questions: how's it going with the early path (getting to fluency with Python, Numpy, Matplotlib,...?) 

Question: Anybody fallen for the Simon Says trap about "source activate" yet? Much debate with Ryan and others about whether multi-environment management is worth its weight up front. 

Take a breath: revisit folders. 
* Home/Jupyter/ 
  * MPO624, live clone of your fork on github.com
  * unidata-python-workshop, dead clone (downloaded, static)
  * room for more. Should there be folders Static/ and GitHub/ ? 

Whiteboard: Elements of a data analysis: get data, process data, create graphics. Each with file-output side doors that can modularize the job into setps. Strategic thinking before plunging in to a hacky session starting at the top. 

Types of data analysis: 
"push" (data driven, characterize)
"pull" (make desired figure, fill results-shaped container) 
"process" (technique is the driving idea -- true of class assignment-labs, but also of science sometimes)
