## 1. general background on computers: 

I’ll sketch out the technology “stack”, from the hardware, to the OS, to the windowing system, to terminal + shell + environment (learn about conda!), to other processes (applications) — especially the  browser (gateway to windowing system), the terminal you launch from, and the underlying jupyter/python-kernel process. 

So many layers: it’s why so many people want to pay Matlab (etc) to manage them all for you in an end-to-end, GUI-driven IDE. But maybe I can motivate people to want to more manually take control of it. At least it’s good to know how deep (tall) your stack is, and the names for layers (so many places where things can go wrong…) 

## 2. practical work, hopefully all the way to operating a Notebook!
 
   a. look at GitHub pull requests (PARTICIPANTLIST.md from all your forked class repos) 

   b. get your forked repos onto your own machine as explained in SETUP_EMAILS.md 

     i. transfer your forked class repo to your local machine by syncing your GitHub fork 

    ii. “clone or download” (not fork; we don’t expect to contribute back) the Unidata Python Workshop
           from https://github.com/Unidata/unidata-python-workshop

    iii. Create an *environment* using conda environment manager

   c. I’ll hope we can get people all the way to 
   
      i. launch jupyter notebook successfully
      ii. take a peek at the Cartopy notebook on your local machine (viewable here). Execute, adjust, see map results! It is viewable at https://github.com/Unidata/unidata-python-workshop/blob/master/notebooks/CartoPy/CartoPy.ipynb, but you will work with your own copy that you’ll have downloaded.
